# Using tags to control access to your Amazon FSx resources<a name="restrict-fsx-access-tags"></a>

To control access to Amazon FSx resources and actions, you can use AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) policies based on tags\. You can provide the control in two ways:

1. Control access to Amazon FSx resources based on the tags on those resources\.

1. Control what tags can be passed in an IAM request condition\.

For information about how to use tags to control access to AWS resources, see [Controlling access using tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_tags.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\. For more information about tagging Amazon FSx resources at creation, see [Grant permission to tag resources during creation](supported-iam-actions-tagging.md)\. For more information about using tags, see [Tag your Amazon FSx resources](tag-resources.md)\.

## Controlling access based on tags on a resource<a name="resource-tag-control"></a>

To control what actions a user or role can perform on an Amazon FSx resource, you can use tags on the resource\. For example, you might want to allow or deny specific API operations on a file system resource based on the key\-value pair of the tag on the resource\.

**Example policy – Create a file system on when providing a specific tag**  
This policy allows the user to create a file system only when they tag it with a specific tag key value pair, in this example, `key=Department, value=Finance`\.  

```
{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
        "fsx:CreateFileSystem",
        "fsx:TagResource"
    ],
    "Resource": "arn:aws:fsx:region:account-id:file-system/*",
    "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
            "aws:RequestTag/Department": "Finance"
        }
    }
}
```

**Example policy – Create backups only on file systems with a specific tag**  
This policy allows users to create backups only on file systems that are tagged with the key value pair `key=Department, value=Finance`, and the backup will be created with the tag `Deparment=Finance`\.  

```

    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "fsx:CreateBackup"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:fsx:region:account-id:file-system/*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "aws:ResourceTag/Department": "Finance"
                }
            }
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "fsx:TagResource",
                "fsx:CreateBackup"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:fsx:region:account-id:backup/*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "aws:RequestTag/Department": "Finance"
                }
            }
        }
     
    ]
}
```

**Example policy – Create a file system with a specific tag from backups with a specific tag**  
This policy allows users to create file systems that are tagged with `Department=Finance` only from backups that are tagged with `Department=Finance`\.  

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "fsx:CreateFileSystemFromBackup",
                "fsx:TagResource"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:fsx:region:account-id:file-system/*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "aws:RequestTag/Department": "Finance"
                }
            }
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "fsx:CreateFileSystemFromBackup"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:fsx:region:account-id:backup/*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "aws:ResourceTag/Department": "Finance"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

**Example policy – Delete file systems with specific tags**  
This policy allows a user to delete only file systems that are tagged with `Department=Finance`\. If they create a final backup, then it must be tagged with `Department=Finance`\. For Lustre file systems, users need the `fsx:CreateBackup` privilege to create the final backup\.

    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "fsx:DeleteFileSystem"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:fsx:region:account-id:file-system/*",
            "Condition": {

                }
            }
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "fsx:CreateBackup",
                "fsx:TagResource"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:fsx:region:account-id:backup/*",
            "Condition": {

                    "aws:RequestTag/Department": "Finance"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

**Example policy – Create data repository tasks on file systems with specific tag**  
This policy allows users to create data repository tasks tagged with `Department=Finance`, and only on file systems tagged with `Department=Finance`\.  

```

    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
