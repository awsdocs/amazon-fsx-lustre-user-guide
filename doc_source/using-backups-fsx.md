# Working with backups<a name="using-backups-fsx"></a>

With Amazon FSx for Lustre, you can take automatic daily backups and user\-initiated backups of persistent file systems that are not linked to an Amazon S3 durable data repository\. Amazon FSx backups are file\-system\-consistent, highly durable, and incremental\. To ensure high durability, Amazon FSx for Lustre stores backups in Amazon Simple Storage Service \(Amazon S3\) with 99\.999999999% \(11 9's\) durability\.

FSx for Lustre file system backups are block\-based, incremental backups, whether they are generated using the automatic daily backup or the user\-initiated backup feature\. This means that when you take a backup, Amazon FSx compares the data on your file system to your previous backup at the block level\. Then Amazon FSx stores a copy of all block\-level changes in the new backup\. Block\-level data that remains unchanged since the previous backup is not stored in the new backup\. The duration of the backup process depends on how much data has changed since the last backup was taken and is independent of the storage capacity of the file system\. The following list illustrates backup times under different circumstances:
+ The initial backup of a brand new file system with very little data takes minutes to complete\.
+ The initial backup of a brand new file system taken after loading TBs of data takes hours to complete\.
+ A second backup taken of the file system with TBs of data with minimal changes to the block\-level data \(relatively few creates/modifications\) takes seconds to complete\.
+ A third backup of the same file system after a large amount of data has been added and modified takes hours to complete\.

When you delete a backup, only the data unique to that backup is removed\. Each FSx for Lustre backup contains all of the information that is needed to create a new file system from the backup, effectively restoring a point\-in\-time snapshot of the file system\.

Creating regular backups for your file system is a best practice that complements the replication that Amazon FSx for Lustre performs for your file system\. Amazon FSx backups help support your backup retention and compliance needs\. Working with Amazon FSx for Lustre backups is easy, whether it's creating backups, copying a backup, restoring a file system from a backup, or deleting a backup\.

Backups are not supported on scratch file systems because these file systems are designed for temporary storage and shorter\-term processing of data\. Backups are not supported on file systems linked to an Amazon S3 bucket because the S3 bucket serves as the primary data repository, and the Lustre file system does not necessarily contain the full dataset at any given time\.

## Backup support in FSx for Lustre<a name="fsxl-backup-support"></a>

Backups are supported only on FSx for Lustre persistent file systems that are not linked to an Amazon S3 data repository\. 

Amazon FSx does not support backups on scratch file systems because scratch file systems are designed for temporary storage and shorter\-term processing of data\. Amazon FSx does not support backups on file systems linked to an Amazon S3 bucket because the S3 bucket serves as the primary data repository and the file system does not necessarily contain the full dataset at any given time\. For more information, see [File system deployment options](using-fsx-lustre.md) and [Using data repositories](fsx-data-repositories.md)\.

## Working with automatic daily backups<a name="automatic-backups"></a>

Amazon FSx for Lustre can take an automatic daily backup of your file system\. These automatic daily backups occur during the daily backup window that was established when you created the file system\. At some point during the daily backup window, storage I/O might be suspended briefly while the backup process initializes \(typically for less than a few seconds\)\. When you choose your daily backup window, we recommend that you choose a convenient time of the day\. This time ideally is outside of the normal operating hours for the applications that use the file system\.

Automatic daily backups are kept for a certain period of time, known as a *retention period*\. You can set the retention period to be between 0â€“90 days\. Setting the retention period to 0 \(zero\) days turns off automatic daily backups\. The default retention period for automatic daily backups is 0 days\. Automatic daily backups are deleted when the file system is deleted\.

**Note**  
Setting the retention period to 0 days means that your file system is never automatically backed up\. We highly recommend that you use automatic daily backups for file systems that have any level of critical functionality associated with them\.

You can use the AWS CLI or one of the AWS SDKs to change the backup window and backup retention period for your file systems\. Use the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateFileSystem.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateFileSystem.html) API operation or the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/fsx/update-file-system.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/fsx/update-file-system.html) CLI command\. 

## Working with user\-initiated backups<a name="user-initiated-backups"></a>

Amazon FSx for Lustre enables you to manually take backups of your file systems at any time\. You can do so using the Amazon FSx for Lustre console, API, or the AWS Command Line Interface \(CLI\)\. Your user\-initiated backups of Amazon FSx file systems never expire, and they are available for as long as you want to keep them\. User\-initiated backups are retained even after you delete the file system that was backed up\. You can delete user\-initiated backups only by using the Amazon FSx for Lustre console, API, or CLI, and they are never automatically deleted by Amazon FSx\. For more information, see [Deleting backups](#delete-backups)\.

### Creating user\-initiated backups<a name="creating-backups"></a>

The following procedure guides you through how to create a user\-initiated backup in the Amazon FSx console for an existing file system\.

**To create a user\-initiated file system backup**

1. Open the Amazon FSx for Lustre console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/fsx/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/fsx/)\.

1. From the console dashboard, choose the name of the file system that you want to back up\.

1. From **Actions**, choose **Create backup**\.

1. In the **Create backup** dialog box that opens, provide a name for your backup\. Backup names can be a maximum of 256 Unicode characters, including letters, white space, numbers, and the special characters \. \+ \- = \_ : /

1. Choose **Create backup**\.

You have now created your file system backup\. You can find a table of all your backups in the Amazon FSx for Lustre console by choosing **Backups** in the left side navigation\. You can search for the name you gave your backup, and the table filters to only show matching results\.

When you create a user\-initiated backup as this procedure described, it has the type `USER_INITIATED`, and it has the **Creating** status while Amazon FSx creates the backup\. The status changes to **Transferring** while the backup is transferred to Amazon S3, until it is fully available\.

## Using AWS Backup with Amazon FSx<a name="aws-backup-and-fsx"></a>

AWS Backup is a simple and cost\-effective way to protect your data by backing up your Amazon FSx file systems\. AWS Backup is a unified backup service designed to simplify the creation, copying, restoration, and deletion of backups, while providing improved reporting and auditing\. AWS Backup makes it easier to develop a centralized backup strategy for legal, regulatory, and professional compliance\. AWS Backup also makes protecting your AWS storage volumes, databases, and file systems simpler by providing a central place where you can do the following:
+ Configure and audit the AWS resources that you want to back up\.
+ Automate backup scheduling\.
+ Set retention policies\.
+ Copy backups across AWS Regions and across AWS accounts\.
+ Monitor all recent backup and restore activity\.

AWS Backup uses the built\-in backup functionality of Amazon FSx\. Backups taken from the AWS Backup console have the same level of file system consistency and performance, and the same restore options as backups that are taken through the Amazon FSx console\. If you use AWS Backup to manage these backups, you gain additional functionality, such as unlimited retention options and the ability to create scheduled backups as frequently as every hour\. In addition, AWS Backup retains your immutable backups even after the source file system is deleted\. This helps protect against accidental or malicious deletion\.

Backups taken by AWS Backup are considered user\-initiated backups, and they count toward the user\-initiated backup quota for Amazon FSx\. You can see and restore backups taken by AWS Backup in the Amazon FSx console, CLI, and API\. Backups created by AWS Backup have backup type `AWS_BACKUP`\. However, you can't delete the backups taken by AWS Backup in the Amazon FSx console, CLI, or API\. For more information about how to use AWS Backup to back up your Amazon FSx file systems, see [Working with Amazon FSx File Systems](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/working-with-other-services.html#working-with-fsx) in the *AWS Backup Developer Guide*\.

## Copying backups<a name="copy-backups"></a>

You can use Amazon FSx to manually copy backups within the same AWS account to another AWS Region \(cross\-Region copies\) or within the same AWS Region \(in\-Region copies\)\. You can make cross\-Region copies only within the same AWS partition\. You can create user\-initiated backup copies using the Amazon FSx console, AWS CLI, or API\. When you create a user\-initiated backup copy, it has the type `USER_INITIATED`\.

You can also use AWS Backup to copy backups across AWS Regions and across AWS accounts\. AWS Backup is a fully managed backup management service that provides a central interface for policy\-based backup plans\. With its cross\-account management, you can automatically use backup policies to apply backup plans across the accounts within your organization\.

*Cross\-Region backup copies* are particularly valuable for cross\-Region disaster recovery\. You take backups and copy them to another AWS Region so that in the event of a disaster in the primary AWS Region, you can restore from backup and recover availability quickly in the other AWS Region\. You can also use backup copies to clone your file dataset to another AWS Region or within the same AWS Region\. You make backup copies within the same AWS account \(cross\-Region or in\-Region\) by using the Amazon FSx console, AWS CLI, or Amazon FSx for Lustre API\. You can also use [AWS Backup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/cross-region-backup.html) to perform backup copies, either on\-demand or policy\-based\.

*Cross\-account backup copies* are valuable for meeting your regulatory compliance requirements to copy backups to an isolated account\. They also provide an additional layer of data protection to help prevent accidental or malicious deletion of backups, loss of credentials, or compromise of AWS KMS keys\. Cross\-account backups support *fan\-in* \(copy backups from multiple primary accounts to one isolated backup copy account\) and *fan\-out* \(copy backups from one primary account to multiple isolated backup copy accounts\)\. 

You can make cross\-account backup copies by using AWS Backup with AWS Organizations support\. Account boundaries for cross\-account copies are defined by AWS Organizations policies\. For more information about using AWS Backup to make cross\-account backup copies, see [Creating backup copies across AWS accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/create-cross-account-backup.html) in the *AWS Backup Developer Guide*\.

### Backup copy limitations<a name="copy-limitations"></a>

The following are some limitations when you copy backups:
+ Cross\-Region backup copies are supported only between any two commercial AWS Regions, between the China \(Beijing\) and China \(Ningxia\) Regions, and between the AWS GovCloud \(US\-East\) and AWS GovCloud \(US\-West\) Regions, but not across those sets of Regions\.
+ Cross\-Region backup copies are not supported in opt\-in Regions\.
+ You can make in\-Region backup copies within any AWS Region\.
+ The source backup must have a status of `AVAILABLE` before you can copy it\.
+ You cannot delete a source backup if it is being copied\. There might be a short delay between when the destination backup becomes available and when you are allowed to delete the source backup\. You should keep this delay in mind if you retry deleting a source backup\.
+ You can have up to five backup copy requests in progress to a single destination AWS Region per account\.

### Permissions for cross\-Region backup copies<a name="copy-permissions"></a>

You use an IAM policy statement to grant permissions to perform a backup copy operation\. To communicate with the source AWS Region to request a cross\-Region backup copy, the requester \(IAM role or IAM user\) must have access to the source backup and the source AWS Region\.

You use the policy to grant permissions to the `CopyBackup` action for the backup copy operation\. You specify the action in the policy's `Action` field, and you specify the resource value in the policy's `Resource` field, as in the following example\.

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "fsx:CopyBackup",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:fsx:*:111111111111:backup/*"
        }
    ]
}
```

For more information on IAM policies, see [Policies and permissions in IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

### Full and incremental copies<a name="copy-incrementals"></a>

When you copy a backup to a different AWS Region from the source backup, the first copy is a full backup copy\. After the first backup copy, all subsequent backup copies to the same destination Region within the same AWS account are incremental, provided that you haven't deleted all previously\-copied backups in that Region and have been using the same AWS KMS key\. If both conditions aren't met, the copy operation results in a full \(not incremental\) backup copy\.

### To copy a backup within the same account \(cross\-Region or in\-Region\) using the console<a name="collapsible-section-1"></a>

1. Open the Amazon FSx console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/fsx/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/fsx/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Backups**\.

1. In the **Backups** table, choose the backup that you want to copy, and then choose **Copy backup**\.

1. In the **Settings** section, do the following:
   + In the **Destination Region** list, choose a destination AWS Region to copy the backup to\. The destination can be in another AWS Region \(cross\-Region copy\) or within the same AWS Region \(in\-Region copy\)\.
   + \(Optional\) Select **Copy Tags** to copy tags from the source backup to the destination backup\. If you select **Copy Tags** and also add tags at step 6, all the tags are merged\.

1. For **Encryption**, choose the AWS KMS encryption key to encrypt the copied backup\.

1. For **Tags \- optional**, enter a key and value to add tags for your copied backup\. If you add tags here and also selected **Copy Tags** at step 4, all the tags are merged\.

1. Choose **Copy backup**\.

Your backup is copied within the same AWS account to the selected AWS Region\.

### To copy a backup within the same account \(cross\-Region or in\-Region\) using the CLI<a name="collapsible-section-2"></a>
+ Use the `copy-backup` CLI command or the [CopyBackup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/APIReference/API_CopyBackup.html) API operation to copy a backup within the same AWS account, either across an AWS Region or within an AWS Region\.

  The following command copies a backup with an ID of `backup-0abc123456789cba7` from the `us-east-1` Region\.

  ```
  aws fsx copy-backup \
    --source-backup-id backup-0abc123456789cba7 \
    --source-region us-east-1
  ```

  The response shows the description of the copied backup\.

   You can view your backups on the Amazon FSx console or programmatically using the `describe-backups` CLI command or the [DescribeBackups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeBackups.html) API operation\.

## Restoring backups<a name="restoring-backups"></a>

You can use an available backup to create a new file system, effectively restoring a point\-in\-time snapshot of another file system\. You can restore a backup using the console, AWS CLI, or one of the AWS SDKs\. Restoring a backup to a new file system takes the same amount of time as creating a new file system\. The data restored from the backup is lazy\-loaded onto the file system, during which time you will experience slightly higher latency\.

The following procedure guides you through how to restore a backup using the console to create a new file system\.

**Note**  
You can only restore your backup to a file system of the same Lustre version type, deployment type, throughput per unit of storage, storage capacity, data compression type, and AWS Region as the original\. You can increase your restored file system's storage capacity after it becomes available\. For more information, see [Managing storage and throughput capacity](managing-storage-capacity.md)\.

**To restore a file system from a backup**

1. Open the Amazon FSx for Lustre console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/fsx/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/fsx/)\.

1. From the console dashboard, choose **Backups** from the left side navigation\.

1. Choose the backup that you want to restore from the **Backups** table, and then choose **Restore backup**\. 

   Doing so opens the file system creation wizard\. This wizard is identical to the standard file system creation wizard, except the file system configuration \(e\.g\., Deployment Type, throughput per unit of storage\)\. However, you can change the associated VPC, and backup settings\.

1. Complete the wizard as you do when you create a new file system\.

1. Choose **Review and create**\.

1. Review the settings you chose for your Amazon FSx for Lustre file system, and then choose **Create file system**\.

You have restored from a backup, and a new file system is now being created\. When its status changes to `AVAILABLE`, you can use the file system as normal\.

## Deleting backups<a name="delete-backups"></a>

Deleting a backup is a permanent, unrecoverable action\. Any data in a deleted backup is also deleted\. Do not delete a backup unless you're sure you won't need that backup again in the future\. You can't delete backups taken by AWS Backup in the Amazon FSx console, CLI, or API\.

**To delete a backup**

1. Open the Amazon FSx for Lustre console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/fsx/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/fsx/)\.

1. From the console dashboard, choose **Backups** from the left side navigation\.

1. Choose the backup that you want to delete from the **Backups** table, and then choose **Delete backup**\.

1. In the **Delete backups** dialog box that opens, confirm that the ID of the backup identifies the backup that you want to delete\.

1. Confirm that the check box is checked for the backup that you want to delete\.

1. Choose **Delete backups**\.

Your backup and all included data are now permanently and unrecoverably deleted\.
