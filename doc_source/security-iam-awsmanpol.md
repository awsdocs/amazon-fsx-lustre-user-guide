# AWS managed policies for Amazon FSx<a name="security-iam-awsmanpol"></a>



To add permissions to users, groups, and roles, it is easier to use AWS managed policies than to write policies yourself\. It takes time and expertise to [create IAM customer managed policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_create-console.html) that provide your team with only the permissions they need\. To get started quickly, you can use our AWS managed policies\. These policies cover common use cases and are available in your AWS account\. For more information about AWS managed policies, see [AWS managed policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-vs-inline.html#aws-managed-policies) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

AWS services maintain and update AWS managed policies\. You can't change the permissions in AWS managed policies\. Services occasionally add additional permissions to an AWS managed policy to support new features\. This type of update affects all identities \(users, groups, and roles\) where the policy is attached\. Services are most likely to update an AWS managed policy when a new feature is launched or when new operations become available\. Services do not remove permissions from an AWS managed policy, so policy updates won't break your existing permissions\.

Additionally, AWS supports managed policies for job functions that span multiple services\. For example, the `ViewOnlyAccess` AWS managed policy provides read\-only access to many AWS services and resources\. When a service launches a new feature, AWS adds read\-only permissions for new operations and resources\. For a list and descriptions of job function policies, see [AWS managed policies for job functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_job-functions.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.



## AWS managed policy: AmazonFSxDeleteServiceLinkedRoleAccess<a name="security-iam-awsmanpol-AmazonFSxDeleteServiceLinkedRoleAccess"></a>

You can't attach `AmazonFSxDeleteServiceLinkedRoleAccess` to your IAM entities\. This policy is linked to a service and used only with the service\-linked role for that service\. You cannot attach, detach, modify, or delete this policy\. For more information, see [Using service\-linked roles for Amazon FSx for Lustre](using-service-linked-roles.md)\.

This policy grants administrative permissions that allow Amazon FSx to delete its Service Linked Role for Amazon S3 access, used only by Amazon FSx for Lustre\.

**Permissions details**

This policy includes permissions in `iam` to allow Amazon FSx to view, delete, and view the deletion status for the FSx Service Linked Roles for Amazon S3 access\.

## AWS managed policy: AmazonFSxServiceRolePolicy<a name="security-iam-awsmanpol-AmazonFSxServiceRolePolicy"></a>

You can't attach AmazonFSxServiceRolePolicy to your IAM entities\. This policy is attached to a service\-linked role that allows Amazon FSx to manage AWS resources on your behalf\. For more information, see [Using service\-linked roles for Amazon FSx for Lustre](using-service-linked-roles.md)\.

This policy grants administrative permissions that allows Amazon FSx to manage AWS resources on the user's behalf\.

**Permissions details**

This policy includes the following permissions\.
+ `cloudwatch` – Allows Amazon FSx to publish metric data points to CloudWatch\.
+ `ds` – Allows Amazon FSx to view, authorize, and un\-authorized applications in your AWS Directory Service directory\.
+ `ec2` – Allows Amazon FSx to do the following:
  + View, create, and disassociate network interfaces associated with an Amazon FSx file system\.
  + View one or more Elastic IP addresses associated with an Amazon FSx file system\.
  + View Amazon VPCs, security groups, and subnets associated with an Amazon FSx file system\.
  + Create a permission for an AWS\-authorized user to perform certain operations on a network interface\.
+ `route53` – Allows Amazon FSx to associate an Amazon VPC with a private hosted zone\.
+ `logs` – Allows Amazon FSx to describe and write to CloudWatch Logs log streams\. This is so that users can send file access audit logs for an FSx for Windows File Server file system to a CloudWatch Logs stream\.
+ `firehose` – Allows Amazon FSx to describe and write to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery streams\. This is so that users can publish the file access audit logs for an FSx for Windows File Server file system to an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream\.
